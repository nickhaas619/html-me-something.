            <h2>How I Got Started</h2>
            <p>Growing up in any generation that had proffessional sports or popular animated cartoons, one would probably have a story about buying a pack of collectible cards.
                <br>
                I personally remember begging my parents for a $2 pack of baseball cards or pokemon cards everytime we went to the store.
                <br>
                 Growing up a St. Louis Cardinals fan, I would go through my $2 pack of cards, and individually sleeve all the cardinals players I could find.
                 <br>
                  Before long, I ended up with hundreds of thousands of "worthless" cards that only value was sentimental... 
                  <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                ... Or so I thought...
                <br>

                <figcaption class = "index-figcap1">"One of the many sleeve books I have kept from my childhood (full of Cardinals cards of course)"</figcaption>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Fast forward to present time.<br> 
                    I stopped collecting cards in my teens. I then began collecting signed football helmets of my favorite players within the last 5 years.<br> 
                    That is when I noticed that certain sports cards were selling for 100's of dollars more than what I was buying autographed helmets for. <br>
                     "How could that be?", "it's just a piece of cardboard, this is a real helmet" is what I thought to myself. <br>
                     I dove deep and found out everything I could about the sports cards and collectible market. I realized there is a huge market for certain<br>
                      players, rookie year cards, autographs, and game-used patches of jerseys, gloves and cleates.<br>
                    Thats when I began my quest to getting back into the hobby I knew so well as a child, and also adding a very profitable aspect as well.<br>
                    Now I only collect the cards of players I truly follow and look up to, and sell what I dont want to keep in my personal collection (PC).

            <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LJN9kYt.jpg?1" width= 600px height= 750px px alt= "personal photo of new, high end sports card boxes"></figure>
            <figcaption class = "index-figcap1">"some different types of sports card hobby boxes"</figcaption>
            <p>There are so many different types of cards one can buy now. Almost every sport has a contract with some type of card producing company.<br>
                 In the photo above you can see just a few types of boxes I have bought over the last few months. A box has a specific number of random cards for a sport.<br>
                  Ones that have guranteed "high-end" cards are called hobby boxes, and ones that arent gurenteed but still possible are called retail boxes. <br>
                Pictured above is just a small portion of the hobby boxes i've purchased this year. A hobby box price can range anywhere from $200 to $2000 <strong>PER BOX!</strong><br>
                 Yes that is super expensive but sometimes the reward outweighs the risk of spending that much money. I have been lucky enough to pull cards out of boxes that i've later sold for $1000's! You can find hobby boxes at a local card shop (LCS). "Retail" boxes 
                are what  one would find at a store like Walmart, or Target, but good luck finding any.<br>
                 There is a huge resale market for retail on ebay too! Even <em>Pokemon, Garbage Pale Kids, and Magic The Gathering</em>
                cards hold a huge value in todays online sale market.
                <br>
                If you still have some of your old cards you collected as a kid, go check them out! you'd be suprised what theyre worth today!

            <h2>A Look At Prices </h2>
            <figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LgF8SdV.png?1" width = 600px height= 750px alt = "personal screenshot photo of ebay comps showing rookie cards that sold for thousands"></figure>
            <figcaption class = "index-figcap1">"Zion Williamson, 2019 rookie for the <em>New Orleans Pelicans</em> is the star of some of the highest record sold basketball cards to date for a new rookie"</figcaption>
            <p>Sadly, the photo above is not cards I have sold, or been lucky enough to get, but notice the sales prices of some of these cards! These are sold "comps" for a rookie last year
                named Zion Williamson. He is one of the biggest up-and-comers in the NBA and his card prices are through the roof!<br>
                To check sold comps on your own: 
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        go to <a href= "https://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a> and have the card you want to look up with you. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Type in the name of the player, company that made the card (ex. Topps, UpperDeck, Panini, etc.), serial number (if any), and some basic details such as: Auto, Rookie, etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Hit that search button and set your "show only" tabs to <em>sold items</em>, and <em>completed items</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now you can scroll through listing that have already been sold and see what they have been selling for in the last few weeks/months!
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <br>
There are many other high-prices players, new and old, and thousands of variations of cards that could worth big money! To alot of people, they see a worthless cardboard picture.<br>
To me, I see gold!
